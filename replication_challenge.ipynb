(Read more fact checks like this one here.) \\u201cLarge numbers of poll watchers were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many key battleground states,\\u201d claimed a Nov. 17 email obtained by Snopes.  Separately, the Trump campaign sent supporters another fundraising email that claimed Republican poll watchers were not \\u201cthrown out\\u201d but prohibited from entering ballot-processing rooms altogether, suggesting that the alleged lack of surveillance benefited President-elect Joe Biden. \\u201cThe best description of this situation is widespread, nationwide voter fraud, of which this is a part,\\u201d Rudy Giuliani, Trump\\u2019s personal attorney, said of the alleged conspiracy by Democrats, without citing any evidence. Together, the emails and Giuliani\\u2019s statement claimed that some unidentified person, or a group of people, ordered Republican poll workers to leave ballot-counting rooms, or to not enter them in the first place \\u2014 essentially breaking laws that allow for poll observers to monitor the elections process on behalf of a political party or candidate. Before we unpack those allegations, let us explain about whom we\\u2019re talking. Every state allows some form of \\u201cpoll watching\\u201d or \\u201celection observing,\\u201d by means of which political parties or candidates appoint volunteers to monitor polling sites for fairness on Election Day. Additionally, states train and certify nonpartisan poll watchers to keep an eye out for any voting issues. Rules governing both types of poll watching, especially to combat any voter harassment or intimidation, vary state by state, and apply to poll watchers regardless of their political affiliation. \\u201cState rules vary on who can be a poll watcher, how many are allowed at polling places or local elections offices, and how they must conduct themselves inside the office or precinct,\\u201d according to The Associated Press. The Trump campaign alleged poll watchers were blocked from doing their jobs \\u201cin many key battleground states,\\u201d though it did not, in its emails, pinpoint one or more locations where this supposedly occurred. Giuliani, however, claimed Democrats in cities including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Phoenix were behind the alleged conspiracy to undermine Trump\\u2019s reelection. No poll watchers with the Democratic party raised issues with the 2020 election. For more details about the Trump campaign\\u2019s allegations, we referred to the campaign\\u2019s lawsuits challenging various aspects of the presidential election to determine where, exactly, the campaign believed citizen monitors were wrongfully kicked out of ballot-processing rooms. At least two legal complaints in Pennsylvania and Michigan involved Republican poll watchers. However, on Nov. 17, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled distancing regulations at polling sites were \\u201creasonable\\u201d in that they allowed poll monitors to see what was happening, as prescribed by state law. (You can read that decision here.) The high court\\u2019s ruling countered an earlier decision by a lower court that sided with the Trump campaign.  Days before that decision, U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond asked a Trump campaign lawyer during a court hearing if poll watchers were allowed in the room where election workers were processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a nonzero number of people in the room,\\u201d campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus replied, acknowledging that Trump representatives were indeed present despite the campaign\\u2019s messaging. Additionally, Republican poll watchers in Michigan\\u2019s Wayne County filed a lawsuit alleging fraud during absentee ballot counting at a Detroit convention center. That litigation sought to halt the state\\u2019s vote certification process. But two judges found no evidence to support the accusations and allowed the process of certifying votes to proceed, finalizing the state\\u2019s voter tallies. Of separate lawsuits, The Associated Press reported: \\u201cOther lawsuits claimed poll watchers were temporarily denied access in some locations, but there has been no evidence to back it up. Nor was there evidence of votes being miscounted out of political bias. And most of the litigation alleging this has been dismissed.\\u201d In other words, there was no evidence of any person or entity blocking poll watchers\\u2019 access to polling sites on Election Day, no matter their presidential candidate of choice. Additionally, there were no reports of someone, or a group of people, \\u201cthrowing out\\u201d poll observers from rooms to which election laws guarantee them the right, as of this report. Those conclusions do not eliminate the possibility that poll watchers at some (or many) sites across the country were asked to follow distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and avoid distracting voters. However, there\\u2019s no proof of such requests being part of a nefarious scheme to help Trump or Biden, or any political cause. We should note here: The emails about poll observers from Trump\\u2019s campaign asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \\u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\\u201d or \\u201cElection Defense Task Force,\\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\\u2019s money was not covering those expenses. Rather, people were giving their money to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, where contributions are divided between Trump\\u2019s committees and the Republican National Committee. \\u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \\u2018official election defense fund\\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, no evidence showed poll watchers were removed or prohibited from rooms were ballots were being counted in the Biden-Trump race, even though physical distancing rules may have affected the monitoring. In fact, one Republican lawyer representing Trump provided evidence to the contrary and acknowledged Republican poll watchers in Philadelphia were indeed allowed in ballot counting rooms.\",\n          \"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on Sunday appeared for their first joint interview since they announced last year that they were stepping back from their duties as members of the British royal family.

Arizona long-term care facility closing unit where patient was allegedly rapedHacienda Healthcare, the Arizona facility where a nurse allegedly raped and impregnated a vegetative patient, has decided to close the unit where she was housed. The company said it \\\"has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate our Intermediate Care Facility for the Intellectually Disabled\\\" after a board directors vote earlier this month, according to a statement released Thursday. \\\"The Hacienda Healthcare Board of Directors, after a great deal of careful consideration, has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate our Intermediate Care Facility for the Intellectually Disabled,\\\" the statement said.  \\\"We have been working with the proper state agencies to develop a plan to help the State transition our ICF-ID patients to other facilities. \\\"Hacienda, a health care provider for \\\"medically fragile and chronically ill\\\" children and young adults, did not say if the patients would be moved to other facilities it operates or to ones owned by other companies. The announcement came two days after Nathan Sutherland, a 36-year-old former nurse, pleaded not guilty to sexual assault and abuse charges after he allegedly raped and impregnated an incapacitated patient at a Phoenix long-term care facility. The 29-year-old woman, who's been comatose for more than a decade, gave birth to a baby boy at Hacienda Healthcare in Phoenix on Dec.  29, sparking allegations of sexual abuse and concerns about patient safety. Investigators said Sutherland's DNA matched a sample from the woman's newborn.  Employees at the facility said they had no idea she was pregnant. Arizona Gov.  Doug Ducey, who recently requested an inquiry into how Hacienda employees didn't notice that a patient had been raped, said Hacienda's decision to move patients is \\u201cvery concerning. \\u201d\\u201cState agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at this facility to ensure patients are safe and well cared for.  For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\\\" Ducey told ABC affiliate KNXV in a statement Thursday.  \\\"Forcing this medically fragile community to move, should be a last resort.  Everyone\\u2019s first priority should be protecting their health and safety. \\u201dThe young woman's identity was withheld, but the San Carlos Apache Tribe confirmed she was as a member.  A spokesperson for the tribe said it is \\\"deeply shocked and horrified\\\" by the alleged abuse. \\\"When you have a loved one committed to palliative care, when they are most vulnerable and dependent upon others, you trust their caretakers,\\\" San Carlos Apache Tribe Chairman Terry Rambler said in a statement Tuesday.  \\\"Sadly, one of her caretakers was not to be trusted and took advantage of her.  It is my hope that justice will be served. \\\"Longtime CEO Bill Timmons resigned last month, a move also backed by the firm's board of directors, and the state's Department of Health Services said it would mandate the facility to operate under stronger guidelines for the time being. The woman's lawyer, John Michaels, said the baby is being cared for by her family.  \\\"The family obviously is outraged, traumatized and in shock by the abuse and neglect of their daughter at Hacienda Healthcare,\\\" Michaels said.  \\\"The family is well aware of the intense news and public interest in their daughter\\u2019s case, but at this time is not emotionally ready to make a public statement.  The family would like me to convey that the baby boy has been born into a loving family and will be well cared for. \\\"ABC News' Marilyn Heck contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n          \"Giving a message to voters in the national capital to come out and vote in the Assembly polls, a bridegroom from east Delhi on Saturday exercised his franchise on the day of his wedding and urged others to fulfil their responsibility towards the nation.Dhananjay, a bridegroom from east Delhi\\u2019s Shakarpur area, that is also part of Laxmi Nagar Assembly constituency, came out to vote with his entire family.Speaking to the media, Dhananjay, while standing outside MCD primary school polling booth here, said, \\u201cI have come out to exercise my franchise as I have a responsibility towards my nation.

His image is the one projected onto the broken bust, also known as \\u201cUncle Theodore.\\u201d Because Thurl bears a slight facial resemblance to Walt Disney (including a similar style of mustache) in the film used for one of the Haunted Mansion busts, many park visitors have confused his likeness with that of Walt Disney. (The notion that Walt\\u2019s image was used on the broken bust as a symbolic tribute to a \\u201cfallen\\u201d leader has helped to perpetuate the rumor, but Walt passed away a few years before the singing bust films were made.
